• Initiation Phase:
	1- market research
		aims to answer the following:
		-the expected age of the target audience.
		-what are their current problems of the old ENR system?
		-who are the competitors?
		-what do they have beyond the value that ENR are providing?
	2- Data Integration
		- Identify best locations or stations based on collecting data from ENR System.
		- Import Database from ENR about trains information(Internal space -> Seats).
                - Import Database from ENR about Schedule.
		- Identify High-season, and low-season based on collecting data from ENR System.
	3- External Contracts
	       ⁛- Contract for health services (first aid, medical assistance, etc.)
		- Contract with NCTH "National Company for Tourism and Hospitality".	


• Building Phase:
	- Make sure that provided features is attainable.
	- Adjust the specifics of the provided service based on the outcome.

	‣ SDLC:
	1- Requirement Specification
	        - Write each US case scenario.
		- Meeting each team requirements:
			-- Source code, servers,...etc
		- Meeting with previous development team.
	2- System Analysis
		- Prompt user to enter the input(passenger info: user name, E-mail, National ID,...etc).
		- The output is ticket info,...
	3- System Design
		- UI/UX design.
		- Design Logo.
              there is more details needed//- Technical design creation.
		- Database Design: ER diagram, Rational schema, Physical schema.
		//- Prototype.
 	4- Implementation
		- Frontend
			-- Web App
				--- Programming Languages needed for develop (React).
			-- Mobile App
				--- Programming Languages needed for develop (Flutter).
		- Backend
			-- Ensures data integrity and prevents the storage of incorrect or inconsistent data.
			-- database building.
			-- API Development.
			-- Optimizing queries.
			-- Implementing caching strategies.
			-- Handle user authentication to control access.
			-- Scalability architecture.
		- Version Description Document
		- Post-Implementation
	5- Testing
		- Establishing test cases.
		- Conduct tests(including unit testing, security testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.)
	6- Deployment
		//- Installation of software onto production computers.
		- Scheduled training sessions for the project team in the software using specifics.
	7- Maintenance


• Launching Phase
	1- market preparation for target audience what are their preferences
        2- set a specific launching plan
	3- marketing team Enablement                  
	4- train the  team over the new features
	5- Customer engagement
		- make tutorials.
		- design user guides.
		- dedicated customer service channels.
	6- marketing and promotions
		- Announcement by The ENR accounts on social media and newspaper.
		- A stage-gate meeting.
		- A multi-step marketing campaign.
